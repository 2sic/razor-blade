This namespace is responsible for all HTML5 tags inside razor. It ensures that each html5 tag is typed and has special 
properties like <em>Src(...)</em> on the image-tag, which will be uri-encoded by default. 
You could use it, but usually you'll use the [Blade.Tag](xref:ToSic.Razor.Blade.Tag) shortcuts instead.
