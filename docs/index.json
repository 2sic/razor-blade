    "keywords": "Razor Guide FavIcons v3.0 Background & Goal This is based on information from sources like https://github.com/audreyr/favicon-cheat-sheet Goal: Create a simple command for the default use case, and provide more complex options for advanced stuff. Basic Default Use Case The default use case should Take just 1 PNG image - to keep it simple. Ideally it could also contain placeholders like {h} & {w} or similar, which if provided would add the size properties to the url, for scenarios where you have an image resizer. This would allow you to do both: \"/portals/0/favicon.png\" \"/portals/0/favicon.png?h={h}&w={w}\" for ImageResizer.net \"/portals/0/favicon.png?height={h}&width={w}\" for Thorstons image resizer \"/portals/0/favicons/icon-{h}x{w}.png\" for pre-resized images Generate the important headers, but not bloat the header with all possible sizes and variations. These would be: favicon for IE 11 - rel=\"shortcut icon\", as png (supported in IE 11) This will cover any IE11 favicon when an html-page is shown. Note that when the browser shows a pdf/image only, it doesn't have html to tell it about favicons, so that will still pick up favicon.ico in the root. general icon - rel=\"icon\", as png, ideally at least 250x250 this is for the general case, but actually I'm not even sure what case that is... touch-icons for mobile devices rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" for 196x196 this supposedly works for iOS and Android. Specifically, we would NOT support the following for now IE 6-10, as these are fully deprecated Mac Desktop icons Windows 10 desktop icons we won't implement rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" as that's only for ios 6 and below So basically it is a command like: HtmlPage.AddIcon(\"/portals/0/favicon.png\") Advanced Use Cases Advanced use cases should allow the following customizations, which limits or extends the icons added. specific list of sizes specific list of known types (icon, shortcut icon, apple-touch...) Not Supported Use Cases Basically anybody can always add more headers to the page using HtmlPage.AddHeader(...) , so it's not necessary to support every exotic variation. This command should make the 80% use cases super easy (just mention 1 file name) and the remaining 15% easy (with addition of parameters), but exotic stuff should not be covered until it's a common standard. These are things probably not supported in the basic API meta tag for msapplication-TileColor and msapplication-TileImage rel=\"apple-touch-icon-precomposed\" as this is for older iOS and iOS devices usually update very often - see also https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/touch-icons"

These will usually be people working with C# and Razor, MVC etc. APIs you're probably looking for APIs for Text with commands like Crop(...) , Ellipsis(...) , First(...) , Has(...) , Zip(...) API for Tags with commands like Text to HTML conversions: Br2Nl(...) , Br2Space(...) , Decode(...) , Encode(...) , Nl2Br(...) , ... Html generators: Attribute(...) , Attributes(...) , Tag(...) API for Tag with all known html5 tags like A(...) , Abbr(...) , Address(...) , Area(...) all the way to Wbr(...) API for HtmlPage with Page properties (get/set): Description , Keywords , Title , ... Methods to add headers: AddIcon(...) , AddIconSet(...) , AddJsonLd(...) , AddMeta(...) , ... Tutorials & Blogs An explanation of the Fluent Tag API We have an extensive tutorial on 2sxc for using RazorBlade We also have many blog posts on RazorBlade What is RazorBlade 3? A library of common functions for Razor, to lighten Razor templates and make work easier. Some examples: You need to change the page title and some headers from a razor template: @using ToSic.Razor.Blade; HtmlPage.Title = \"Title changed using Razor Blade! original\"; HtmlPage.Description = \"Learn to use Razor Blade \" + HtmlPage.Description; HtmlPage.Keywords = \"Tutorial, Razor, Blade\" + HtmlPage.Keywords; HtmlPage.AddMeta(\"somename\", \"somevalue\"); HtmlPage.AddIcon(\"iconfile.png\"); You need the first 100 characters followed by an ellipsis (if truncated), but umlauts like &uuml; will mess up your count or might even be cut off. This is automatically handled by: @* just cut it off at the visible character count, not splitting words *@ @Text.Crop(someText, 100) @* truncate a text and if necessary, add ellipsis character *@ @Text.Ellipsis(longText, 100) @* now the same thing, with text having html-tags *@ @Text.Ellipsis(Tags.Strip(longText), 100) You need a value, but if it's empty (null, spaces, line-breaks, &nbsp; etc.), you need another one: @* Do this *@ @Text.First(firstName, \"nothing found\"); @* instead of this *@ @if(String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(firstName as string)) { @\"nothing found\" } else { @firstName } Note that HTML whitespace like &nbsp; will also be treated as empty, unless you add false as a last parameter. But RazorBlade does more than just skip empty texts, here some more examples: @* First non-empty of many possible values *@ @Text.First(nameFromDb, nameFromProfile, defaultNameForThisCountry, \"unknown\") @* remove html from a wysiwyg-string *@ @Tags.Strip(formattedText) @* the same with a custom ending *@ @Text.Ellipsis(longText, 100, \"...more\") @* an it won't cut off in the middle of &auml; *@ @Text.Ellipsis(\"Visit M&uuml;nchen\", 10)"

    "keywords": "RazorBlade ChangeLog Version 3 Version 3.0 (2019-10-21) Created website with full API documentation Razor-Blade.net Created all Html5 tags and quick-accessor using Tag.xxx Breaking Changes We really hate to introduce breaking changes, but 3.0 was a good opportunity for this. Renamed everything to use the namespace ToSic.Razor.Blade from previously Connect.Razor.Blade . This was improtant, because we decided to release RazorBlade as a NuGet package, and the previous namespace Connect didn't make any sense. Renamed the DLL to be in-line with the changes, which also means that previous code still works, because the new namespace can run side-by-side with the previous one Reorganized some internal APIs, so they won't disturb in public documentation Modified the Text.First() method so it could now take an unlimited amount of strings to pick the first one. Moved primary repo in Github to 2sic Version 2 Version 2.02 (2019-10-15) Improved the Add and Wrap on the fluid API AddIconSet(...) now defaults to using the provided image as the favicon Version 02.01 (2019-10-14) HtmlPage got AddIcon and AddIconSet - see tutorial Version 2.00 (2019-04-09) Released first draft of Fluent Tag API which was later brought to final in 3.0 Version 1 Version 1.02 (2019-04-05) Created draft HtmlTags API - which was later completed in 3.0 Version 1.01 (2019-02-27) Created HtmlPage API to read/write DNN header properties and add all kind of headers Version 1.00 (2019-02-17) Released RazorBlade Created Text... and Tags...

    "keywords": "Razor Blade Fluent Tag API v3.0 The Tag Objects The Tag objects generate Html tags inside RazorBlade and provide a powerfull API will let you build html from code. These docs will give you what you need to leverage the object. Here you'll find: a Quick-Reference for the common API more instructions for doing specific things advanced API for special stuff To see this in action with many examples, visit the RazorBlade Tutorials on 2sxc.org . How to get Tag Objects The following APIs will get you Tag objects: Tag.*() where * is any standard HTML5 term, like Div , Hr , IFrame etc. - returns a typed object with more methods like Src(url) on Tags.Img() v2.2 Tag.*(content) same thing like above, but with content in the constructor Tags.*(content1, content2, ...) same thing like above, but with much content in the constructor Tag.Custom(string tagName) ( more ) Fluent API for Tag (Chaining) All these methods of a Tag change the object, and return the object itself again. This fluent-API allows chaining them together, like someTag.Id(\"someId\").Class(\"float-right\") Below we'll explain the methods that all Tag objects have, but many have custom commands as well. For example, an Img Tag also has a Src(...) while an A Tag also has href . Some of the additional commands are extra-smart and automatically URI encode the value if not yet encoded. Modifying Tag Attributes Attr(name, [value], [separator]) add an attribute - if it already exists, it will replace the value, unless a separator is specified which will then append the new value. name : string , required value : string | object | null , optional Objects will be JSON serialized; null will result in the attribute being added without a value, like disabled separator : string , default is \"\" Separation character if we have to append to an existing value. If null, will replace instead of append. Class(value) set / add a class to the tag; if called multiple times, will append with a space between the original and new value. When calling with null, will reset the class to empty. Data(name, [value]) will add a data-{name}='value' attribute. Id(value) set the id attribute - if called multiple times, will always replace previous id On(name, jsCode) add an event-attribute like onclick Style(value) set / add a class to the tag; if called multiple times, will append with a semicolon ; between the original and new value. When calling with null, will reset the id to empty. Title(value) set the title attribute - if called multiple times, will always replace previous title Modifying the Tag Contents Add(value) Add something to contents - at the end of existing content. value : string | Tag | IEnumerable<string|Tag> Add(value, value, ...) v2.2 Add a many items to contents - at the end of existing content. value : string | Tag Wrap(value) Replaces the content value : string | Tag | IEnumerable<string|Tag> Wrap(value, value, ...) v2.2 Replaces the content with many items value : string | Tag Output/Render API A Tag object and the two properties .Open and .Close all support IHtmlString , so you can output them directly: @myTag will render the tag into the html. Implements IHtmlString and will not be encoded. @myTag.TagStart will render the opening tag to html. Implements IHtmlString and will not be encoded. myTag.TagEnd will render the close-tag to html. Implements IHtmlString and will not be encoded. _Note: the TagStart and TagEnd have unusually long names, to ensure that the terms won't collide with future attribute names like Open etc. @using ToSic.Razor.Blade; @Tags.Tag(\"br\") @Tags.Tag(\"div\").Wrap(\"this is my message\") @{ var myStyle = Tags.Tag(\"style\"); } @myStyle.Open .red { color: red}; @myStyle.Close All Html5 Tags and Attributes The Tag object provides access to all known Html5 tags. Read the full API <!-- ## Options When Generating Custom Attributes and Tags Options like `AttributeOptions` and `TagOptions` are an optional parameter in all generator-commands. It allows you to change how attributes are generated, but remember that the default is well thought through, so you usually won't need to use it. ### AttributeOptions _(new in 2.0)_ The object has the following properties and defaults: 1. `Quote` _string, default=`_ - the quote character used for wrapping values. The single-quote is the default, as it allows you to place json (which has double-quotes) in the value without having to encode the double quotes 2. `EncodeQuotes` _boolean, default=false_ - determines if quote-characters inside the value should be encoded when not necessary. So by default `data='{\"key\":\"value\"}` is what you get, but if you set it to true, you get `data='{\"key\":\"value\"}`. 3. `KeepEmpty` _boolean, default=true_ - determines if empty attributes like `data` in `<div data=''></div>` are actually placed in the html, or filtered out. This is how you would use these: ```razor @* Example without options *@ <div @Attribute(\"data\", \"45\")>...</div> @* Example with options directly *@ <div @Attribute(\"data\", \"45\", new AttributeOptions { KeepEmpty = false })> @* Example with using options multiple times *@ @{ var options = new AttributeOptions { Quotes = \"\\\"\", EncodeQuotes = false }; } <div @Attribute(\"data\", \"45\", options)></div> ``` -->"

For now, we recommend using Dictionary<string, object> to prepare the data you want to add. HtmlPage.AddOpenGraph(property, content) add an open-graph tag to the header for facebook, twitter and co. v1.1 HtmlPage.AddToHead(string) - Add anything to the <head> section of the page. The string should usually contain a meta, link or script tag. v1.1 HtmlPage.AddIcon(path) add an icon (favicon) to the page v2.1 ...AddIcon(path, rel: string, size: int, type: string) - all optional parameters to specify things like rel : the rel-text, default is 'icon'. common terms are also 'shortcut icon' or 'apple-touch-icon size : will be used in size='#x#' tag; only relevant if you want to provide multiple separate sizes type : optional type, if not provided, will be auto-detected from known types or remain empty HtmlPage.AddIconSet(path) add a few icon headers to the page according to best practices v2.1 ...AddIconSet(path, favicon: bool|string, rels: IEnumerable<string>, sizes: IEnumerable<int>) - all optional parameters to specify things like favicon : boolean - auto-add a default favicon tag (or not) favicon : string - use this url for the favicon tag rels : list/array of rel-texts (a separate icon tag will be generated for each rel) sizes : list/array of sizes (a separate icon tag will be generate for each size) note: if you supply rels and sizes , then all combinations of icon tags will be added note: you can't specify the type, as each one could be different - the auto-detection will take care of this for you Performance Optimizations The commands above are available for comfortable use. Internally, each command finds the page object and manipulates it. If you would like to optimize the code a bit, the GetPage() command gives you an object with the same features, but will run a few percent faster. So you can also do this: var p = HtmlPage.GetPage(); p.Title = \"...\"; p.Keywords = \"...;"
