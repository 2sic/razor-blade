# Oqtane API Decorator Attributes

This folder contains special attributes for the API Code Generator.

The idea is that only items marked with special attributes are valide public APIs, and only these will be documented in the public docs 

As of 2020, all APIs are documented, and only these marked as `[PrivateApi]` will be excluded. In future, we may reverse this to only document things marked as `[PublicApi]`.
